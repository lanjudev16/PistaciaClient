                            Access Token: An access token is a credential that is used to access protected resources or perform certain actions on behalf of an authenticated user.The access token is included in each request to the server's protected resources to prove the user's identity and permissions. It contains information such as the user's identity and the granted permissions or scopes.

                        <p className="divider"></p>
                        <p>
                            Refresh Token: A refresh token is a long-lived credential that is used to obtain a new access token when the current one expires. Unlike access tokens, refresh tokens are not meant to be included with each request to access protected resources. Instead, they are securely stored on the client-side, typically within a secure session or a token vault. When the access token expires, the client can use the refresh token to request a new access token from the authentication server without requiring the user to reauthenticate.

                                1. It's databases follow a structured data model with predefined schemas. They use tables to organize and store data, where each table has a fixed set of columns and rows. Relationships between tables are established using foreign keys.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                2. It's databases traditionally scale vertically by adding more resources to a single server. This approach has limitations in terms of scalability and handling large amounts of data and traffic.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                3. It's databases use the SQL language for defining, manipulating, and retrieving data. SQL provides a standardized way to interact with relational databases and supports powerful querying capabilities, including complex joins, aggregations, and transactions.
                            </li>

                                4.  It's used for applications that require complex transactions, strict data consistency, and structured data relationships. They are well-suited for applications such as financial systems, e-commerce platforms, and content management systems.

                                1.  It's databases offer a flexible and dynamic data model. They are schema-less and can store unstructured, semi-structured, or structured data. NoSQL databases use various data models, such as key-value, document, columnar, or graph, to store and retrieve data.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                2. It's databases are designed for horizontal scalability. They can distribute data across multiple servers and handle high volumes of data and traffic by adding more nodes to the database cluster.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                3. It's databases often have their own query languages or APIs specific to their data models. The query languages vary between different NoSQL databases but generally provide efficient and flexible data retrieval options tailored to the specific data model.
                            </li>
                            <li>

                            Express.js is a popular web application framework for Node.js. It provides a minimalistic and flexible approach to building web applications and APIs. Express.js simplifies the process of handling HTTP requests, routing, middleware management, and rendering responses. It is known for its simplicity, lightweight nature, and vast ecosystem of plugins and middleware. Express.js allows developers to create robust and scalable web applications using JavaScript on the server-side.

                            NestJS is a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications. It leverages TypeScript as its primary language, which adds static typing and enhanced tooling capabilities to JavaScript. NestJS follows the modular architecture pattern and is heavily inspired by Angular, a popular front-end framework. It provides a powerful set of features such as dependency injection, declarative routing, middleware, authentication, database integration, and more. NestJS aims to improve developer productivity and maintainability while enabling the creation of robust and scalable back-end applications.

                            In MongoDB, the aggregate method is used to perform advanced data aggregation operations on collections. It allows you to process and transform documents within a collection to retrieve aggregated results based on specified criteria.
                        </p>
                        <p className='divider'></p>
                        <h3 className='py-2'>
                            Here's a high-level overview of how the aggregate method works:
                        </h3>
                        <ul className='space-y-2'>
                            <li>
                                1. Match Stage: This optional stage filters the documents in the collection based on specified criteria using the $match operator. Only the documents that match the criteria are passed to the next stage.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                2. Project Stage: The $project stage allows you to shape the output documents by specifying which fields to include or exclude. It also supports computed fields and transformations using various operators.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                3. Group Stage: The $group stage groups documents together based on a specified key and performs aggregation operations on the grouped data. Aggregation operators like $sum, $avg, $min, $max, and others can be used to calculate aggregate values within each group.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                4. Sort Stage: The $sort stage sorts the documents based on specified criteria, such as a field value or an aggregate result.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                5. Limit and Skip Stages: The $limit and $skip stages allow you to control the number of documents returned or to paginate through the result set.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                6. Other Stages: MongoDB provides various other stages, such as $lookup for performing left outer joins with other collections, $unwind for flattening arrays, $facet for multi-faceted aggregation, and more.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                }
            </div>
        </div>
    );
